# AWESOME TODOS APP

## Long story short:

It’s a React app with a to-do list, with TypeScript. 

## Why so AWESOME?

Firstly, if you’ve just started learning to program\
you can find a lot of helpful things here to do better apps.\
If you’re looking for some fresh inspiration,\
search this app and find something for you.\
For a list of details, see the text below.

Secondly, awesome for me, it was my first big project,\
which taught me many new advanced functions, technologies,\
methods, ways to do something better and faster and many many more.

## What does this app do?

Download the app, and run it "npm run" in a terminal,\
the app will fetch some tasks and you are going to see a notification.\ 
After the above, you can use an input-bar to search the tasks by name,\
or filter tasks by category when you click one from the three icons,\
on the right side near the input-bar.\
Click a plus icon to add a new task, or click a list icon\
under the plus button to show, done tasks.\
The tasks allow you to delete them or change their status (to do/done).

### Technologies in app:
  -	i18n, to handle text in the app in one place and if needed translate it easier.
  -	Redux + Saga, to fetch tasks, manage them, and perform actions on them in one source of truth.
  -	Husky to improve commits.
  -	Prettier to save time and make code prettier.
  -	Linter to analyzing source code looking for errors.
  -	Aphrodite to support collocating styles with components.
  -	Formik with yup to manage forms with validation.
  -	Uuidv4 to adding the unique identifiers.
  -	Debounce to improve the performance of a code.
  -	Redux-devtools for better work with a database.
  -	And many React technologies and features like a hooks.

## How to install and run:

Firstly you need to download any IDE (integrated development environment),\
I recomend you the Visual Studio Code.\
Also download and install a node.js.\
Next will be Git.

If everything has been successfully installed, make a folder where you want to\
install the app.\
And open the project directory, now you need to make a app copy.\
You can download a ZIP with the app from this side if you click green button "Code",\
past it to your folder and unzip files.

Open the VSC and make sure You are a in main folder where the app is.\
Type in the terminal `npm install` and after installation `npm start`,\
if all went well, the app show you in your browser. \
If not, try to open this link [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\
Both of these ways open the app in development mode.
